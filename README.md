### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nermin Sehic

As a software developer with a love for all things code, I enjoy working with languages like Go, Typescript, Java, Scala, and React more than I enjoy my morning coffee (okay, maybe that's a stretch). 

Currently, I'm putting my skills to use at Rendr, where I'm building internal tools to make people's jobs a little less painful (because who doesn't love a good tool that saves time and frustration?). 

When I'm not coding, you can find me trying to perfect my latte art or attempting to keep my plants alive (both tasks that require a certain level of patience and dedication, much like debugging code).
