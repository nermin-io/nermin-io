Hi, Iâ€™m Nermin. I'm a software developer building cool things on the web.

Iâ€™m an Oracle Certified Professional Java programmer, but over time I have amassed experience and a passion for a multitude of languages such as Java, Scala, Typescript, Node.js and more. 

Iâ€™m currently building Zendesk Support Apps and other internal tools at Rendr, a fulfilment and delivery technology company in Richmond. On the side, I like to work on personal projects, tinker with new technologies and languages, and write on my personal blog.
